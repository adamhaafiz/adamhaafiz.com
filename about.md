![Adam Haafiz](../images/me.jpg){:width="200px"}

Hey there! My name is **Adam**. I'm a mobile app developer at [Apptivity Lab](https://www.apptivitylab.com), a consulting agency that specialises in iOS and Android applications. At work I'm primarily involved in the development of iOS applications, but I'm able to contribute on the Android side too. 

Listening to music is an essential part of my workflow, therefore I'm always resisting the urge to airdrum along to my favourite songs. On my way to work, I usually listen to these awesome podcasts:

* [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar) - great show on indie iOS development
* [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) - where I learned everything I know about security
* [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) - huge fan of CGP Grey
* [Mobile Couch](http://mobilecouch.co/) - lots of interesting discussions on mobile development
* [The raywenderlich.com Podcast](https://www.raywenderlich.com/rwpodcast) - 20 minute sessions covering various sectors of programming

## Projects
Some of the projects I've been involved with outside of work:

* [myc!](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/myc/id1171061589?mt=8) - helping the youths of today find jobs & scholarships
* [SpaceDex](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/geotagging-space-and-aviation/projects/spacedex) - hacked together for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016
* [BeanThere](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/beanthere/id1081914113?mt=8) - helping you find the closest place for a caffeine fix
* [Centrestage](http://www.centrestage.my) - custom WordPress theme built from scratch
* ss-haze-bot - internal Slack bot that kept users up to date on latest air pollutant index info
