![Adam Haafiz](../images/me.jpg){:width="200px"}

My name is **Adam Haafiz**. I'm a mobile app developer at [Apptivity Lab](https://www.apptivitylab.com), a company that specialises in delivering the most delightful iOS and Android applications. I also dabble in other fields such as web development, security, networking and bots.

Listening to music is an essential part of my workflow, therefore I'm always resisting the urge to airdrum along to my favourite songs. On my way to work, I usually listen to these awesome podcasts:

* [Under the Radar](https://www.relay.fm/radar) - great show on indie iOS development
* [Security Now](https://twit.tv/shows/security-now) - where I learned everything I know about security
* [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) - huge fan of CGP Grey
* [Mobile Couch](http://mobilecouch.co/) - lots of interesting discussions on mobile development
* [The raywenderlich.com Podcast](https://www.raywenderlich.com/rwpodcast) - 20 minute sessions covering various sectors of programming

## Projects
Some of the projects I've been involved with:

* [myc!](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/myc/id1171061589?mt=8) - helping the youths of today find jobs & scholarships
* [SpaceDex](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/geotagging-space-and-aviation/projects/spacedex) - hacked together for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016
* [BeanThere](https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/beanthere/id1081914113?mt=8) - helping you find the closest place for a caffeine fix
* [Centrestage](http://www.centrestage.my) - custom WordPress theme built from scratch
* ss-haze-bot - internal Slack bot that kept users up to date on latest air pollutant index info

## Misc
Outside of work, thoughts of our technology-driven future excite me (self-driving cars, anyone?). At home, I own a small form factor desktop that dual boots Windows (for gaming) and macOS (for everything else).
