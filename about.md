![Adam Haafiz](../images/me.jpg){:width="200px"}

Hey there! My name is **Adam**. I'm a senior mobile app developer with over four years of experience building iOS and Android applications. I've been involved in every stage of the development process from ideation, design, development and deployment. Listening to music is an essential part of my workflow, therefore I'm always resisting the urge to airdrum along to my favourite songs. 

## Projects
I've contributed to various apps throughout my career. Some highlights:

* [Vidi](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1357463458) - discover and share travel videos, book travel offers
* [Axiata Core Values](https://itunes.apple.com/app/core-values/id1280902326?mt=8) - play mini games for points, redeem points for prizes
* [Samsung AC Support](https://itunes.apple.com/app/ac-support/id1339539596?mt=8) - utility app for Samsung air con technicians
* [Enterprise Asia](https://itunes.apple.com/app/enterprise-asia/id1234188458?mt=8) - news app for NGO that also helps members to connect
